ðŸ”µ LeetCode 1539: Kth Missing Positive Number

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`,
return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.

-----------------------------------
Constraints:
    - 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
    - 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
    - 1 <= k <= 1000
    - arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length

    Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?

def findKthMissing_linear(arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:

    This function finds the kth missing positive integer using a linear scan.
    
    Approach:
      - Initialize a counter for missing numbers and a variable for the current number.
      - Iterate starting from 1 and compare with the array elements.
      - Increase the missing counter when a number is not found in the array.
      - When the missing count equals k, return that number.

    Finds the kth missing positive integer using binary search.
    
    Key Observation:
      - For any index i, the number of missing numbers before arr[i] is:
            missing(i) = arr[i] - i - 1
      - Use binary search to find the smallest index such that missing(i) >= k.
    
    If such an index is found:
      - The kth missing number is: arr[index-1] + (k - missing(index-1))

    Alternative Approach Using a While/For Loop to Compare k with Gaps in the Array
    
    Approach:
      - Initialize a variable `prev` to 0 (representing the number before the first positive integer).
      - Iterate through each number in `arr` and calculate the missing numbers between `prev` and the current number:
            missing = current number - prev - 1
      - If k is less than or equal to the missing count, the kth missing number is `prev + k`.
      - Otherwise, subtract the missing count from k and update `prev` to the current number.
      - If k remains after processing all elements, the kth missing number is beyond the last element:
            return arr[-1] + k
