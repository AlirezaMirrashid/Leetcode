ðŸ”· LeetCode 246: Strobogrammatic Number

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees 
(i.e., looked at upside down).  Each digit must map to a valid digit when rotated:
  - '0' â†” '0'
  - '1' â†” '1'
  - '6' â†” '9'
  - '8' â†” '8'
  - '9' â†” '6'

Write a function to determine if a number (given as a string) is strobogrammatic.

Example 1:
    Input: "69"
    Output: True
    Explanation: '6' becomes '9', '9' becomes '6' â†’ "69" reversed is "96", matches original.

Example 2:
    Input: "88"
    Output: True
    Explanation: '8'â†’'8', '8'â†’'8' â†’ reversed mapped string is "88".

Example 3:
    Input: "962"
    Output: False
    Explanation: '2' has no valid mapping.

Constraints:
    1 â‰¤ s.length â‰¤ 50
    s consists only of digits.

We provide two methods:
 1. Two-pointer in-place check (O(n) time, O(1) extra space)
 2. Build & compare mapped string (O(n) time, O(n) space)
