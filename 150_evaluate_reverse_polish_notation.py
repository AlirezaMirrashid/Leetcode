ðŸ”µ LeetCode 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

Return the evaluated result as an integer.

Rules:
- The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
- Operands are integers.
- Division truncates toward zero.
- The input is a valid RPN expression.

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

Example 2:
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

Example 3:
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22

-----------------------------------
Constraints:
- 1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4
- tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200]

    âœ… Stack-based Evaluation

    Idea:
    - Use a stack to evaluate expressions in RPN.
    - Push operands to the stack.
    - When an operator is encountered, pop two operands, apply the operation, push result back.
