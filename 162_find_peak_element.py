ðŸ”µ LeetCode 162: Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element and return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is 
always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index 1 where the peak element is 2, 
or index 5 where the peak element is 6.

-----------------------------------
Constraints:
    - 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    - -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
    - nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

    Finds a peak element in the given array and returns its index.
    
    Approach:
      - Uses Binary Search to achieve O(log n) time complexity.
      - If nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1], the peak is on the left side, move left.
      - Else, the peak is on the right side, move right.
    
    Time Complexity: O(log n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)

        nums (List[int]): A list of integers.
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of a peak element.
