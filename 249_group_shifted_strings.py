üî∑ LeetCode 249 - Group Shifted Strings

üß† Task:
Given a list of strings that consists only of lowercase letters, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.

A shifting sequence is defined as follows: if we shift each letter of a string to its successive letter (with 'z' wrapping around to 'a'),
we obtain another string in the same sequence. For example, "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz". All strings with the same pattern of differences
between adjacent characters belong to the same group.

-----------------------------------
Example:
Input: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"]
Output:
[
  ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
  ["az","ba"],
  ["acef"],
  ["a","z"]
]
Explanation:
- "abc", "bcd", and "xyz" all share the same pattern [1, 1] (shifting differences modulo 26).
- "az" and "ba" share the pattern [25] (or [-1] mod 26).
- "acef" has a unique pattern.
- Single-character strings are grouped together.
  
-----------------------------------
Constraints:
    - 1 <= strings.length <= 10^4
    - 1 <= strings[i].length <= 100
    - strings[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

        Groups shifted strings based on their difference signature.
        
        Approach:
          - For each string, compute a signature based on the differences between consecutive characters
            modulo 26. This signature is represented as a tuple.
          - Strings of length 1 have an empty signature and are grouped together.
          - Use a dictionary to aggregate strings with the same signature.
