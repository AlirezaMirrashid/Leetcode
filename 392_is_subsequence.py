ðŸ”µ LeetCode 392: Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the 
characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters (e.g., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" 
while "aec" is not).

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

-----------------------------------
Constraints:
    - 0 <= s.length <= 100
    - 0 <= t.length <= 10^4
    - s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

Follow up:
    Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 10^9, and you want to check one by one to see if 
    t has its subsequence. In this scenario, you could preprocess t by mapping each character to all its indices and then 
    use binary search for each query.

    Optimal Two-Pointer Approach

    Approach:
      - Use two pointers: one for s and one for t.
      - Traverse t, and if the current character in t matches the current character in s, increment the s pointer.
      - If the s pointer reaches the end of s, then s is a subsequence of t.

    Follow-Up: Preprocessing with Binary Search Approach

    Approach:
      - Preprocess t by building a dictionary that maps each character to a list of its indices in t.
      - For each character in s, use binary search (via bisect) on the corresponding list in the dictionary 
        to find an index greater than the previous index found.
      - If for any character no valid index is found, return False.
    
    Time Complexity:
