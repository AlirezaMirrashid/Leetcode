ðŸ”µ LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array 'prices' where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No profitable transaction is possible, so the output is 0.

-----------------------------------
Constraints:
    - 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
    - 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

    Optimal Two-Pointer Approach (Using left and right pointers)

    Approach:
      - Initialize two pointers: 'l' (buy day) and 'r' (sell day), with l = 0 and r = 1.
      - As we iterate, if prices[l] is less than prices[r], compute the profit (prices[r] - prices[l])
        and update the maximum profit.
      - If prices[l] is not less than prices[r], then a new potential buy day is found, so update l to r.
      - Increment r until the end of the list.
      - Return the maximum profit found.

    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of days (length of prices).
    Space Complexity: O(1), constant space usage.

    Parameters:
        prices (List[int]): List of stock prices on consecutive days.
    
    Returns:
        int: The maximum profit that can be achieved.
