üî∑ LeetCode 1091: Shortest Path in Binary Matrix (Medium)

üß† Task:
Given an n x n binary matrix `grid`, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix.
A clear path is defined as a path from the top-left cell (0,0) to the bottom-right cell (n-1,n-1)
where:
  - Every visited cell is 0.
  - Every adjacent cell in the path is 8-directionally connected.
The length of the path is the number of visited cells. If there is no clear path, return -1.

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: -1

-----------------------------------
Constraints:
    - n == grid.length and n == grid[i].length
    - 1 <= n <= 100
    - grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

        ‚úÖ Optimal BFS Approach
        
        Approach:
          - Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from (0,0) if it's clear (0). 
          - Explore 8-directional moves from each cell.
          - Maintain a visited set or mark the grid to avoid re-processing cells.
          - When reaching the bottom-right cell, return the number of steps.
          - Return -1 if no path is found.
