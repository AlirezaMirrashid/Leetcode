ðŸ”µ LeetCode 68. Text Justification

Given an array of words and a maximum width `maxWidth`, format the text so that each line is exactly `maxWidth` characters long and fully justified.

Rules:
- Use a greedy approach to fit as many words per line as possible.
- Distribute extra spaces evenly between words. If uneven, more spaces go to the left.
- The last line is left-justified.

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]

Example 2:
Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]

Example 3:
Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]

-----------------------------------
Constraints:
- 1 <= words.length <= 300
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
- 1 <= maxWidth <= 100
- words[i].length <= maxWidth

    âœ… Greedy and Space Distribution

    Idea:
    - Group words into lines with as many as can fit.
    - For each line, distribute spaces evenly.
    - Handle the last line separately (left-justified).
