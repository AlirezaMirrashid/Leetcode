ðŸ”µ LeetCode 704: Binary Search

You are given an array of integers `nums`, sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`.
Write a function to search for `target` in `nums`. If the target exists, return its index; 
otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 
    The number 9 exists at index 4 in the array.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 
    The number 2 does not exist in the array.

-----------------------------------

Constraints:
    - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
    - -10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4
    - All integers in nums are unique.
    - nums is sorted in ascending order.

    """
    This function implements binary search on a sorted array `nums` to find the index of `target`.
    If the `target` exists in `nums`, it returns its index. Otherwise, it returns -1.
    
    The algorithm uses the binary search approach, which reduces the search space by half at each step.
    
    Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the length of the input array. The search space is halved at each step.
    Space Complexity: O(1), as the function uses a constant amount of extra space.
    
    Args:
        nums (List[int]): The list of integers (sorted in ascending order).
        target (int): The integer value to search for in the list.
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of the target in the list, or -1 if not found.
