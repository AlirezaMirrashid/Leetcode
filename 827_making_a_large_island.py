üî∑ LeetCode 827 - Making A Large Island

üß† Task:
You are given an n x n binary matrix `grid`. You may change at most one 0 to 1.
Return the size of the largest island after this operation. An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 to connect two islands of size 1 ‚Üí size 3.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Flip the 0 to 1 ‚Üí single island size 4.

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: No zeros to flip; largest island is 4.

Constraints:
  - n == grid.length == grid[i].length
  - 1 <= n <= 500
  - grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.

        ‚úÖ Optimal Two-Pass with Component Labeling

        1) First pass: flood-fill each island of 1s with a unique id (starting from 2)
           and record its area in a map `area[id]`.
        2) Second pass: for each 0 cell, look at its 4-directional neighbors,
           collect distinct island ids, sum their areas + 1 (for the flipped cell),
           track the maximum.
        Also handle the case of no zero in grid (max area unchanged).
