ðŸ”· LeetCode 695: Max Area of Island (Medium)

You are given an m Ã— n binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`â€™s (land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in that island.  
Return the maximum area of an island in `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

Example 1:
    Input:
        grid = [
          [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
          [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
          [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
          [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
          [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
          [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
          [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
          [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
        ]
    Output: 6

Example 2:
    Input:
        grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
    Output: 0

Constraints:
    m == grid.length
    n == grid[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 50
    grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
