üî∑ LeetCode 398: Random Pick Index

üß† Task:
Given an integer array `nums` with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number.
You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.
If there are multiple valid indices, each index should have an equal probability of being returned.

Implement the `Solution` class:
  - __init__(nums): Initializes the object with the array nums.
  - pick(target): Picks a random index i from nums such that nums[i] == target.

-----------------------------------
Example:
Input:
  nums = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]
  pick(3) ‚Üí It should return one of indices: 2, 3, or 4 randomly.
  pick(1) ‚Üí Should return index 0, because it's the only occurrence.
Output:
  [null, 4, 0, 2]   (Output order may vary as long as the returned index is correct and random.)

-----------------------------------
Constraints:
    - 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
    - -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
    - target is an integer from nums.
    - At most 10^4 calls will be made to pick.
