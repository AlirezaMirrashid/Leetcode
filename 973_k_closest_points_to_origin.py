LeetCode 973: K Closest Points to Origin
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

Description:
    Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and 
    an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance 
    (i.e., âˆš((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)). You may return the answer in any order. 
    The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Examples:
    Example 1:
        Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
        Output: [[-2,2]]
        Explanation:
            Distance from (1,3) to (0,0) = sqrt(1^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(10)
            Distance from (-2,2) to (0,0) = sqrt((-2)^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(8)
            Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2,2) is closer to the origin.

    Example 2:
        Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
        Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
        Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

Constraints:
    - 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
    - -10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4

    """
    Returns the k closest points to the origin (0, 0) using a heap-based approach.

    This function maintains a max-heap of size k (by storing negative distances) to keep track of
    the k closest points. For each point, it computes the Euclidean distance to the origin. If the
    heap has fewer than k elements, the point is pushed onto the heap. Otherwise, if the current
    point is closer than the farthest point in the heap, it replaces the farthest point.

    Parameters:
        points (List[List[int]]): A list of points, where each point is represented as [x, y].
        k (int): The number of closest points to return.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list of the k closest points to the origin.

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
#
# Time Complexity: O(n log k)
#   - We process each of the n points, and each heap operation takes O(log k).

# Space Complexity: O(k)
#   - We maintain a heap of size k.
