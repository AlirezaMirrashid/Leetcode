ðŸ”µ LeetCode 138: Copy List with Random Pointer

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could 
point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new 
node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of 
the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and 
copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the 
original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the 
corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

-----------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Explanation: 
    The deep copy of the list is created such that each new node has the same value as its corresponding 
    original node, and the next and random pointers are set accordingly.

Example 2:
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
Explanation:
    The deep copy is created, where for each node in the original list, the random pointer of the new node 
    points to the new copy of the node pointed to by the original random pointer.

Example 3:
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

-----------------------------------
Constraints:
    - 0 <= n <= 1000
    - -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
    - Node.random is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list.
